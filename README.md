 # MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis
 # Overview of the Project 
    The purpose of this project is to review the production data for insights that might help the manufacturing team to overcome production troubles 
    blocking their progress.
   
    The Analysis include the following:
    * Perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes
    * Collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots
    * Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population
    * Design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers.
